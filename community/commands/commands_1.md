## -spoonfeeding
**Response:**  
We do not support spoonfeeding. We won't be doing your homework, 
we won't implement a feature for you, we won't get a call with you and carry walk you through how to do X. 
However, we will patiently talk with you, try to explain the topic, the tools, the approach. 
Our goal is to teach you "how to fish", but you will have to "catch the fish" yourself.
