## Garbage Collectors
Welcome to Garbage Collectors (GC). We try to focus on "long-term" mentoring/guidance. 
We therefore, recommend you to follow a course in #official-material , 
request exercises in the corresponding channel (e.g. for python it is #exercises-requests 
but it requires you to have chosen your role in #roles). You can submit your exercise 
to get feedback by one of our mentors. For simple questions, just slide into the question 
section of the language!
